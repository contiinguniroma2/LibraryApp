1.   As a user, I want to check in advance if there are free seats in the library, so I don’t waste time if there aren’t.

2.   As a student, I want to search for a library in a specified location, so I can study with no noise.

3.   As a librarian, I want to update the library free seats situation, so other people can join it.
