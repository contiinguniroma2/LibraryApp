1. As a student, I want to find a free seat in libraries around me, so I don’t waste my time.

2. As a librarian, I want to know the statistics about the flow of    people that attend the library, so that I can organize the staff.    

3. As a librarian, I want to update with one click the number of free seats, so that I can give the possibility to the students if there are free seats.
