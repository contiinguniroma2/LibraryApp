1. As a student, I want to book a seat in selected library, so I'm sure to find a seat.

2. As a librarian, I want to know the statistics about the flow of people that attend the library, so that I can organize the staff.    

3. As a librarian, I want to update with one click the number of free seats, so that I can give the possibility to the students if there are free seats.
